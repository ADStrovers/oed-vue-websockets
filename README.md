# Websockets Example

## Goals

 - Interface with Pusher applications that is backed by the Pusher Datasource API.  For this you will need the PusherJS library (already included in the project).  Use key '85d7e982ffd04c44f323'.

 - Be able to Subscribe to a channel using an input box for the channel name
 
 - Respond to new tweets being pushed back by the Pusher object.
 
 - Allow a user to unsubscribe from a channel
 
## Hints

I tried to leave some hints in the repo to show how it was solved previously.  You are more than welcome to use these hints or just delete the components folder altogether and run from there.

If you want to see the final project, just move back to the previous commit and you will have the somewhat completed code.

## What's next?

If/When you accomplish all of this, go ahead and add in some new features.  Try grabbing Vuex and running all of this through store mutations.  Find some new tool and use that!  Enjoy Vue.
